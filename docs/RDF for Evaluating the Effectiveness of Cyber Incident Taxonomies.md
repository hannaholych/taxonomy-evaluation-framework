# Evaluating the Effectiveness of Cyber Incident Taxonomies with a Requirement-Driven Framework
---
## Requirement Group: Structural Requirements
---
### Requirement Name: Logical Structure
Categories and subcategories of the taxonomy are logically related to each other.

- **Logical Consistency**: A consistent logic or framework for how taxonomy categories are created and maintained is applied, ensuring that each follows the same foundational principles.<br>
- **Contextual Relevance**: The taxonomy structure ensures that each subcategory is relevant to and falls within the context of its parent category, providing a logical connection between them.<br>
  *```Example: There are "Accidental Exposure", "Malicious Insider", and "External Intrusion" subcategories under the "Data Breaches" category which are all logically related to data breaches.```*<br>
- **Minimal Cross-Referencing**: The taxonomy categories are clearly distinct and the need for excessive cross-referencing between categories is minimised.<br>
  *```Example: Instead of cross-referencing "Ransomware" under both "Malware" and "Financial Attacks", it can be placed under a single logical parent, such as "Malware", and provide context for its financial motivations within the subcategory description.```*
- **Logical Progression**: The progression from general categories to more specific subcategories follows a logical sequence, ensuring that more specific incidents are naturally nested under more general ones.<br>
  *```Example: A high-level category like "Cyber Attacks" is progressively divided into "Network Attacks", "Application Attacks", and then further into more specific types like "SQL Injection" or "Cross-Site Scripting".```*<br>
- **Thematic Consistency**: The taxonomy categories are grouped by common themes or attributes, ensuring that subcategories share a common basis for their classification.<br>
  *```Example: All human-centric incidents (e.g., "Insider Threats", "Phishing") are grouped separately from system-centric incidents (e.g., "Malware", "DDoS") to maintain thematic consistency.```*

### Requirement Name: Hierarchical Organisation
The taxonomy has a clear hierarchical structure and supports multiple levels of classification (e.g., broad categories, subcategories) to allow threats to be categorised at different levels of detail (allow for both high-level overviews and granular analysis).

- **Multi-Level Classification**: The taxonomy is structured in multiple levels, allowing incidents to be categorised from broad, general categories to more specific, detailed subcategories.<br>
  *```Example: A multi-level classification system allows for the breakdown of a broad category (like "Cyber Attacks") into more specific subcategories (such as "Network Attacks" or "Application Attacks") and further into detailed levels (like "DDoS" or "SQL Injection"). Each level adds more specificity, allowing for a nuanced and detailed categorization of different types of cyber incidents.```*  
- **Contextual Navigation**: The taxonomy enables users to navigate through categories in a logical way without losing context, meaning that each level or category provides context to the next, helping users to understand where they are and what comes next in the hierarchy. It ensures that the navigation from one category to another makes logical sense and that users can intuitively follow the progression from general to specific (or vice versa) while maintaining an understanding of how each category relates to others.<br>
  *```Example: If a user starts with a high-level category like "Data Breach", they can logically navigate to "Causes of Data Breach", then to "External Breaches" or "Internal Breaches", and further into specifics like "Phishing-Induced Breaches" under "External Breaches". Contextual navigation would prevent a user from encountering unrelated categories abruptly. For example, moving from "Data Breach" to "Malware" without any logical connection would violate contextual navigation.```*
- **Parent-Child Relationships**: The taxonomy provides clear relationships between the categories, where the data is organised like a tree and each subcategory (child) logically derives from or is a subset of a broader category (parent). This ensures a structured hierarchy where each child is fully contained within its parent category and where each parent can have many children but each child has only one parent.<br>
  *```Example: If "Insider Attacks" is the parent category, it logically includes child subcategories ("Malicious Insider" and "Unintentional Insider"), which are further broken down into more specific types of insider threats (for example, grandchild categories "Disgruntled Employee" and "Privileged User Misuse" for "Malicious Insider" category). Each child and grandchild maintains a logical connection to its parent.```*

### Requirement Name: Modularity
The taxonomy is modular to accommodate new types of threats or modifications without requiring a complete overhaul. It enables easy addition, modification, or removal of categories and supports extensions or plug-ins for new threat types.

- **Independent Updates**: The taxonomy supports independent updates to different modules or sections. It is structured so that individual parts (modules) can be updated independently without affecting the integrity or consistency of the other parts of the taxonomy.<br>
  *```Example: We have "Financial Gain", "Political Ideology", and "Hacktivism" under the "Motivations" module. If the taxonomy supports isolated refactoring, merging "Political Ideology" and "Hacktivism" into a broader "Ideologically Motivated" category affects only the "Motivations" module. It has no further effect on how incidents are technically described or attributed.```*
- **Extensibility**: The taxonomy is designed to allow new categories or subcategories to be added easily as the need arises, ensuring it remains adaptable to emerging threats, new areas of interest, and specific use cases. It ensures that the taxonomy can grow and evolve over time, accommodating new developments in the cyber threat landscape without requiring a major redesign.<br>
  *```Example: If a new attack vector, such as "Quantum Cryptography Attacks", becomes relevant, the taxonomy should allow for a seamless addition of this new category (it could be added as a subcategory under "Advanced Cryptographic Attacks") to reflect advancements in attack techniques without having to change the other existing structures or relationships.```*
- **Easy Modification**: The taxonomy enables easy modification or removal of categories without needing a complete overhaul. The taxonomy is constructed in a way that allows easy modifications, such as renaming, merging, splitting, or deleting categories and subcategories, without needing a complete overhaul and causing confusion or loss of information. It ensures that any necessary changes — whether to improve clarity, adapt to new terminology, or better represent current understanding — can be implemented efficiently and clearly.<br>
  *```Example: If it becomes clear that two categories, such as "Credential Theft" and "Identity Theft", are too similar or overlapping, the taxonomy should allow for easy merging of these categories into a single, more precise category, like "Identity Compromise", without requiring major adjustments to the other parts. Conversely, if a category like "Social Engineering" is found to be too broad, it should be easily divisible into more specific subcategories like "Phishing", "Vishing", and "Pretexting", to enhance clarity and specificity.```*

## Requirement Group: Content Requirements
---
### Requirement Name: Comprehensive Coverage (Completeness)
The taxonomy covers all possible relevant types of cyber incidents.

- **Inclusion of All Incident Types**: The taxonomy encompasses all known and relevant types of cyber incidents in accordance with the agreed cyber incident classification scheme, ensuring that no significant incident category is omitted. It is also broad enough to cover the full spectrum of cyber threats, from traditional ones like malware and phishing to emerging threats like AI-based attacks or quantum computing threats. It also includes incidents across different domains, such as network, application, human, and physical layers.<br>
- **Holistic Incident Attributes**: The taxonomy captures all relevant aspects of cyber incidents and details on them (offers details on threat actors, such as their motivations (e.g., financial gain, espionage) and capabilities; provides context for potential impacts (e.g., data loss, service disruption) and affected assets; includes information about attack vectors (e.g., phishing, malware), tactics, and techniques). It includes the key attributes or characteristics that define and differentiate various types of threats, covering the "who, what, where, when, why, and how" of each threat. This criterion ensures that the taxonomy captures the essential attributes of each incident, such as its origin, methods, targets, impact, motivation, and mitigation strategies, which helps in understanding the nature and scope of each incident.<br>
  *```Example: For each incident type, the taxonomy provides details (attributes) like "Origin", "Attack Vector", "Target", "Impact", "Motivation", and "Mitigation Strategies". Then an example item under "Phishing" category can have the following attribute values: "Origin" — external; "Attack Vector" — email; "Target" — user credentials; "Impact" — credential theft, data breach; "Motivation" — financial gain, espionage; "Mitigation Strategies" — email filtering, user training, multi-factor authentication.```*<br>

### Requirement Name: Clarity and Precision
Each category and subcategory of the taxonomy is clearly defined with unambiguous terminology. It provides clear definitions and examples for each incident type; terminology is consistent and easily understandable without additional context by various stakeholders.

- **Clear Definitions**: Each category, subcategory, and term within the taxonomy has a precise and understandable definition that clearly explains its meaning and scope. This criterion ensures that every element of the taxonomy is well-defined so that users can easily understand what each category represents without needing additional explanations. Clear definitions prevent confusion and make it easier to consistently apply the taxonomy across different contexts.<br>
  *```Example: The category "Phishing" can be defined as "a type of social engineering attack where an attacker sends fraudulent messages (typically emails) designed to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information or downloading malware". The category "Ransomware" can be defined as malware that encrypts a victim's data and demands payment (ransom) for the decryption key. Defining "Phishing" specifically as a "social engineering attack" and "Ransomware" as "malware" helps to differentiate them clearly within the taxonomy, so users know exactly what is being referred to in each case.```*
- **Consistent Terminology**: The taxonomy uses consistent uniformly applied terminology and naming conventions across all categories and subcategories to describe similar or identical concepts, avoiding synonyms or varying descriptions that could confuse users. Consistent terminology enhances understanding and reduces the likelihood of misclassification.<br>
  *```Example: If "malware" is used to describe malicious software, that term should be used consistently instead of alternating between "malware", "malicious code", or "badware". Also, instead of using both "Internal Threat" and "Employee Misconduct" terms interchangeably for referring to the same behaviour, the term "Insider Threat" can be chosen to be used within the taxonomy consistently.```*
- **Avoidance of Ambiguity**: The taxonomy avoids ambiguous or overlapping terms that can be interpreted in multiple ways or are open to subjective judgement. This criterion ensures that each term or category has a clear, singular meaning, minimising the risk of different interpretations by different users. Avoiding ambiguity helps to ensure that the taxonomy is applied in the same way by all users, maintaining consistency in its use.<br>
  *```Example: Using terms like "Critical Incident" is avoided without defining what makes an incident critical (e.g., the impact level, the type of data involved, or the systems affected). Ambiguous terms like "Potential Threat" are replaced with more specific categories such as "Emerging Threat" (for new, evolving threats) or "Suspected Malicious Activity" (for activities under investigation but not yet confirmed).```*

### Requirement Name: Independence
The taxonomy maintains independence from vendors, technologies, platforms, and tools, ensuring broader applicability and utility across diverse contexts.

- **Vendor-Neutral Language**: The taxonomy avoids any mention of specific vendor names, products, or proprietary technologies.<br>
  *```Example: Generic terms like "antivirus software" are used instead of referring to a specific product like "Symantec Endpoint Protection".```*
- **Technology-Agnostic Terminology**: The taxonomy avoids terminology that is tied to a specific technology, platform, or tool, and uses general, widely-accepted terms that apply across different contexts.<br>
  *```Example: The term "network intrusion detection" is used instead of "Snort alerts", or "email filtering" rather than "Windows Defender filtering".```*
- **Generic Incident Descriptions**: The taxonomy describes threats in abstract (generic) terms that can apply to multiple environments, systems, implementations or tools without relying on specifics tied to a single platform or product.<br>
  *```Example: A category like "Credential Theft" is defined that applies across Windows, Linux, and macOS environments, rather than focusing on "Windows Credential Theft".```*
- **Cross-Platform Relevance**: The taxonomy ensures categories and definitions are relevant across multiple platforms and environments (e.g., cloud, on-premises, hybrid) without preference for one over another.<br>
  *```Example: Categories such as "Cloud Misconfiguration" and "On-Premises Network Misconfiguration" are included to cover diverse environments or they are both merged into one category "Misconfigurations".```*
- **Avoidance of Proprietary Formats and Approaches**: The taxonomy is independent from proprietary approaches and does not rely on any proprietary data formats, or representations specific to certain vendors. If this criterion is ignored, it makes cross-platform sharing and interpretation difficult, as well as limits access to organizations that use or can afford a specific vendor’s solutions.<br>

### Requirement Name: Mutual Exclusiveness
Each category and subcategory of the taxonomy do not overlap, and each element or item can be assigned to only one classification item without ambiguity.

- **Granularity Control**: The taxonomy uses granular subcategories only when necessary and ensures they are subsets of a unique parent category without crossing into others.<br>
  *```Example: If "Insider Attack" has subcategories like "Malicious Insider" and "Unintentional Insider", creating separate subcategories under "Human Error" that overlap with "Unintentional Insider" is avoided.```*
- **Label Exclusivity**: The taxonomy uses unique labels for categories and subcategories that do not imply or suggest inclusion in another category.<br>
  *```Example: Distinct terms (like "Data Manipulation" versus "Data Theft") are used to avoid implying overlap between altering data and stealing data. Also "Phishing" and "Social Engineering" are clearly differentiated if both are present, or "Phishing" is made a subcategory under "Social Engineering".```*
- **Classification Distinction**: The taxonomy ensures the scope delimitation and establishes specific criteria for classifying each incident type to ensure that it falls into only one category.<br>
  *```Example: "SQL Injection" is classified under "Application Layer Attacks" based on its method (injection) and target (database) rather than under "Data Breach" unless it leads to actual data exposure.```*

## Requirement Group: Usability Requirements
---
### Requirement Name: Ease of Use
The taxonomy has an intuitive navigation and straightforward categorization in order to stay user-friendly for a wide range of users, including security analysts, managers, and policymakers. It is also supported by documentation and training materials.

- **Logical Structure**: The taxonomy has a clear, intuitive structure that organises categories and subcategories in a way that makes sense to users, following a logical flow from general to specific or vice versa. This criterion ensures that users can easily understand how categories are related and can navigate through them without confusion. 
A logical structure often follows a hierarchical format, where top-level categories are broad, and each subsequent level provides more specific details. This structure follows a logical progression from broad types of cyber incidents to more specific types, making it easier for users to find the information they need quickly.<br>
- **User Guidance**: The taxonomy provides clear guidance and instructions for users on how to use it effectively, including explanations, definitions, and examples. This criterion involves providing supplementary materials such as a user manual, guidelines, FAQs, tooltips, or integrated help features that assist users in understanding the taxonomy, how to categorise threats correctly, and how to navigate through it.<br>
- **Predefined Training Sessions**: All users of the cyber incident taxonomy have an opportunity to access training programs that help them to understand, navigate, and use the taxonomy effectively. This helps users to stay informed about how the taxonomy works, how to apply it to real-world scenarios, and how to use any new features or updates efficiently. The criterion means that there should be predefined, regular training sessions that teach users how to effectively use the taxonomy, especially as new updates are rolled out. This ensures that the taxonomy remains user-friendly and accessible, even for users who may not be familiar with it.<br>
  *```Example: Initial onboarding sessions are conducted for new users who are unfamiliar with the taxonomy to receive introductory training, helping them to learn the system quickly. When a significant update or new version of the taxonomy is released, an update-specific training is scheduled to teach users how to navigate and use the new features. Practitioners can also participate in hands-on, interactive workshops where users can practise using the taxonomy to classify real or simulated incidents.```*
- **Search and Filter Capabilities**: The taxonomy includes robust search and filtering tools that allow users to quickly find specific categories, subcategories, or attributes of cyber incidents. This criterion ensures that users can easily search for specific threats or filter results based on certain criteria, such as type, impact level, or method of attack. These capabilities enhance usability by reducing the time and effort required to locate relevant information.<br>
  *```Example: The taxonomy has a search bar where users can type keywords like "Phishing" or "Ransomware" to directly find related categories. Filtering options are also available that allow users to refine their search by specific parameters.```*
- **Support of Visual Representation and Visualisation Tool Integration**: The taxonomy supports visual representation methods (e.g., graphs, tree diagrams) for enhanced understanding. Dynamic visualisations can be generated based on user-selected attributes or the taxonomy is integrated with visualisation tools to display trends, patterns, or correlations.<br>

### Requirement Name: Flexibility
The taxonomy is flexible enough to be applied across different sectors and use cases (to a reasonable extent, since generalisation is limited). It accommodates sector-specific needs (e.g., finance, healthcare) and is adaptable for different purposes (e.g., threat intelligence, incident response) in order to be changed easily according to the situation.

- **Sector Adaptability**: The taxonomy is adaptable across different industries or sectors, ensuring its relevance and applicability regardless of the specific context in which it is used. This criterion requires the taxonomy to be designed in a way that makes it useful for multiple sectors, such as finance, healthcare, government, education, and critical infrastructure. It includes categories and subcategories that are broad enough to apply across sectors but also detailed enough to address sector-specific threats.<br>
  *```Example: The taxonomy includes the category "Data Breaches" that is relevant to most sectors. In Healthcare, a data breach might involve patient records being exposed due to a ransomware attack. In Finance, it might involve unauthorised access to financial databases containing customer information.```*
- **Multi-Use Suitability**: The taxonomy is suitable for various purposes, such as threat analysis, incident response, risk management, training, and reporting. This criterion ensures that the taxonomy can be employed for different uses within an organisation or across different organisations. It is structured to support a wide range of activities, from operational tasks like threat detection to strategic tasks like risk assessment and planning.<br>
  *```Example: For threat analysis, the taxonomy allows analysts to categorise and assess threats based on attributes like attack type, vector, and severity. For incident response, the taxonomy helps responders to identify the type of threat and determine appropriate response actions quickly. For training and awareness, it provides clear examples and definitions of various threat types to educate employees about potential threats and their characteristics. For reporting purposes, it aligns with standard reporting frameworks, like those used by regulatory bodies or industry standards, to facilitate clear communication of threat data.```*
- **Customisation Options**: The taxonomy allows for customization to suit the specific needs or preferences of different organisations or users. This criterion ensures that the taxonomy can be tailored by users to meet their unique requirements. It should support modifications like adding new categories, renaming existing ones, merging or splitting categories, or altering definitions and attributes to fit specific organisational contexts without disrupting its overall structure, ensuring that it remains relevant and aligned with their operational needs.<br>
  *```Example: A financial institution may want to add a specific subcategory for "Payment Card Fraud" under "Financial Fraud", which might not be necessary for other sectors. A government agency could customise the taxonomy to include categories specific to state-sponsored threats or critical infrastructure attacks, such as "Nation-State Espionage" or "Critical Infrastructure Sabotage".```*

### Requirement Name: Interoperability
The taxonomy is compatible and aligns with commonly used standards, frameworks and guidelines in cybersecurity (e.g.,ISO/IEC series, MITRE ATT&CK knowledge base, FIRST CSIRT Services Framework, NIST Cybersecurity Framework, CVE/CWE standards), supports standard formats, and integrates with tools and platforms used for threat intelligence.

- **Standards Alignment**: The taxonomy aligns with recognized industry standards, frameworks, or guidelines to ensure compatibility and facilitate communication and understanding across different organisations and sectors. This criterion ensures that the taxonomy follows widely accepted standards, such as those provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), ISO/IEC (International Organization for Standardization) and so on. Alignment with these standards enhances the taxonomy's credibility, increases its adoption, and ensures it is compatible with existing industry practices.<br>
  *```Example: Following standards like ISO/IEC 27001, the taxonomy may use specific terms and definitions for security controls, threat actors, and risk management. Integration with the MITRE ATT&CK knowledge base might include incident categories that map directly to the tactics or techniques in the MITRE ATT&CK matrix. If this criterion is ignored, it limits the ability to collaborate with partners due to a lack of shared understanding and may hinder compliance with regulatory expectations.```*
- **Format Compatibility**: The taxonomy is compatible with widely recognized data formats commonly used in cybersecurity to facilitate data exchange and integration with various tools and platforms. Compatibility with these formats enables the taxonomy to be imported, exported, and shared easily across different systems, tools, and platforms.<br>
  *```Example: Ensuring compatibility with JSON, YAML and XML allows the taxonomy to be used in various cybersecurity tools, such as SIEMs (Security Information and Event Management systems), threat intelligence platforms, and incident response tools. Providing the taxonomy in a CSV format usually allows for easy integration with spreadsheet tools for analysis and reporting purposes.```*
- **Tool Integration**: The taxonomy integrates seamlessly with existing cybersecurity tools, platforms, and processes. The taxonomy is designed to integrate smoothly with common cybersecurity tools, platforms, and technologies used for incident detection, analysis, response, and reporting. This criterion ensures that the taxonomy can be directly integrated into tools such as SIEM, SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response), IDS/IPS (Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems), threat intelligence platforms, GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) tools and so on. This integration allows for seamless operation, reducing manual efforts and ensuring consistent use of the taxonomy across different tools and processes.<br>
  *```Example: Integration with SIEM platforms allows the taxonomy to categorise and correlate threats and alerts automatically, helping security analysts to identify and respond to incidents quickly. Compatibility with SOAR tools enables automated workflows that use the taxonomy to categorise and prioritise incidents and initiate predefined response actions. Integration with threat intelligence platforms can help to map incoming threat intelligence feeds to specific categories within the taxonomy, enhancing situational awareness and threat detection capabilities. Support for GRC tools ensures that the taxonomy aligns with organisational policies, risk management practices, and compliance requirements.```*

### Requirement Name: Actionability
The taxonomy enables actionable insights for decision-making, risk assessment, and incident mitigation. It supports the identification of threat patterns and trends, and provides actionable recommendations based on classifications.

- **Incident Prioritisation**: The taxonomy helps users to rank incidents by their importance, urgency, or impact, enabling them to focus on the most critical incidents first. This criterion ensures that the taxonomy includes attributes that allow for the prioritisation of incidents based on factors such as severity, likelihood, impact, or exploitability. By categorising incidents in this way, security teams can determine which incidents require immediate attention, which can be monitored, and which are lower priority.<br>
  *```Example: The taxonomy could include attributes such as "Severity Level" , "Impact Level" (Critical, High, Medium, Low), "Likelihood" (how probable it is for an incident to occur based on historical data and threat intelligence). Any "Critical" incident with a high likelihood and high potential impact (such as a known ransomware campaign targeting the organisation’s sector) would be prioritised over a "Low" severity incident with low impact (such as minor phishing attempts).```*
- **Risk Mitigation Support**: The taxonomy facilitates the identification and implementation of risk mitigation strategies by clearly defining incident types, associated risks, and possible countermeasures. This criterion ensures that the taxonomy provides actionable information that aids in developing and executing risk mitigation plans. By categorising incidents based on their nature and characteristics, the taxonomy helps users to understand which risks are associated with each type of an incident and what countermeasures or controls could mitigate those risks.<br>
  *```Example: The taxonomy links each incident category to specific risk mitigation strategies. "DDoS Attacks" category is linked to mitigation strategies like rate limiting, DDoS protection services, and network segmentation. "Insider Threats" category is linked to strategies such as user behaviour analytics, stricter access controls, and regular security awareness training. This enables security teams to quickly identify appropriate measures to reduce the risk associated with different types of incidents.```*
- **Enabling Strategic Recommendations**: The taxonomy provides a foundation for making strategic decisions and recommendations related to cybersecurity posture, resource allocation, and long-term planning. This criterion ensures that the taxonomy supports decision-making at the strategic level by providing insights into threat trends, emerging threats, and areas that need improvement. It helps organisations to align their security strategies with the evolving threat landscape, guiding investment in cybersecurity resources, technologies, and policies.<br>
  *```Example: If incident trends show an increasing number of incidents related to a specific threat type (e.g., supply chain attacks), this could prompt strategic investments in securing supply chains or enhancing third-party risk management. If the "Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)" category is identified as a significant risk, the organisation might decide to allocate more resources to threat hunting and intelligence capabilities.```*

### Requirement Name: Granularity
The taxonomy offers sufficient granularity to support detailed analysis without becoming overly complex. It balances detailed categorization with simplicity, avoiding excessive fragmentation that can hinder usability.

- **Multiple Levels of Analysis**: The taxonomy supports different levels of detail, enabling users to conduct both high-level overviews and in-depth analyses as needed. This criterion ensures that users can navigate between a high-level understanding of incidents and a detailed analysis of specific incident types, tactics, or attributes.<br>
  *```Example: Let's assume that the taxonomy has a top-level category such as "Malware", which is then broken down into subcategories like "Ransomware", "Spyware", "Adware", etc. Each subcategory is further divided into more specific types, such as "Locker Ransomware" and "Crypto Ransomware". At a high level, security managers may only need to see the overall count of malware incidents. At a detailed level, incident responders might need to analyse the specific subtype of ransomware involved, its distribution method, and its encryption algorithm. This multi-level approach allows users to filter and drill down based on the level of analysis required for their role or task.```*
- **Balancing Detail Level and Avoiding Over-Fragmentation**: The taxonomy strikes a balance between providing sufficient detail and avoiding unnecessary fragmentation that makes it overly complex or difficult to use. This criterion ensures that categories are neither overly broad nor overly specific and that the taxonomy does not include so many subcategories or attributes that it becomes cumbersome or overwhelming. It provides enough detail to be meaningful and useful but avoids over-fragmentation and does not break down categories into so many subcomponents that it could complicate analysis, decision-making or maintenance.<br>
  *```Example: If the taxonomy includes a category like "Phishing", it provides enough detail to distinguish between subcategories like "Spear Phishing", "Whaling", and "Clone Phishing", but does not go so far as to include extremely niche variants that rarely occur or have minimal impact. Over-fragmentation can occur if a taxonomy has a hundred subcategories under "Phishing", each representing a minor variation. Instead, it could group some variants together under broader subcategories like "Targeted Phishing" (e.g., Spear Phishing, Whaling) or "Mass Phishing".```*
- **Consistent Level of Detail**: The taxonomy maintains a consistent level of granularity across all categories and subcategories, ensuring that each level of the taxonomy offers a similar depth of detail. This criterion ensures that similar categories are described with similar levels of granularity. This avoids situations where some categories are very detailed and others are overly broad, which can create confusion and reduce the taxonomy’s effectiveness.<br>
  *```Example: If "Malware" is divided into types (e.g., "Virus", "Worm", "Ransomware"), "Network Attacks" are also similarly divided (e.g., "DDoS", "Man-in-the-Middle", "Spoofing") without leaving any category more or less detailed than the others.```*

### Requirement Name: Measurability
The taxonomy allows for measurable analysis, enabling tracking of trends and incident frequencies as well as monitoring changes and improvements over time.

- **Quantifiable Points**: The taxonomy is designed in a way that allows specific aspects of cyber incidents to be measured quantitatively. This criterion ensures that the taxonomy includes elements or attributes that can be counted, scored, or otherwise quantified. Quantifiable points help organisations to assess threat levels, monitor incident frequency, and evaluate the impact of different incidents over time. These measurements provide valuable metrics for reporting, performance evaluation, decision-making, and strategic planning.<br>
  *```Example: Each category and subcategory in the taxonomy can be used to generate data on the number of incidents that have occurred within a specific timeframe (e.g., the number of "Phishing" incidents per month). The taxonomy might also assign a severity score to each type of threat (e.g., "Critical", "High", "Medium", "Low"), allowing organisations to prioritise incidents and allocate resources accordingly.```*
- **Trend Analysis Support**: The taxonomy should facilitate the identification and analysis of patterns and trends in cyber incidents over time, in particular providing metrics for tracking analysis. This criterion ensures that the taxonomy is structured in a way that supports longitudinal analysis, allowing organisations to track changes in threat activity, types, or frequency over time. By supporting trend analysis, the taxonomy helps to identify emerging incidents, shifts in attack patterns, and the effectiveness of security measures.<br>
  *```Example: The taxonomy can be used to analyse the frequency of different types of incidents (e.g., increasing occurrences of "Supply Chain Attacks" over the last year). Organisations can also use the taxonomy to assess how changes in security controls impact incident activity (e.g., whether implementing advanced email filtering has reduced the frequency of "Phishing" attacks), checking the effectiveness of controls. The taxonomy might support geographical analysis to identify if certain regions are experiencing specific incidents more frequently (e.g., increased "DDoS Attacks" in a particular country or sector).```*

---
## Requirement Group: Adaptability Requirements
---
### Requirement Name: Scalability and Dynamic Updating
The taxonomy is scalable to accommodate changes in the cyber landscape and to handle new incident data. It supports a growing number of categories, subcategories, and attributes to rapidly incorporate new threats, techniques, or tactics.

- **Scheduled Update Mechanisms**: The taxonomy has predefined processes and schedules for regular periodic updates (e.g., automatic updates, scheduled reviews) to incorporate new incident types, tactics, techniques, and technologies. This criterion ensures that there is a formalised process for periodically reviewing and updating the taxonomy to accommodate future expansions, such as new incident categories or subcategories, to reflect changes in threat environment. Scheduled updates help to maintain the taxonomy's relevance by ensuring it includes the latest threats, vulnerabilities, and attack methods.<br>
  *```Example: The taxonomy is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis to include newly identified threat types, changes in attack vectors, or significant cybersecurity trends. The taxonomy is also linked to automated data feeds (e.g., threat intelligence platforms) that provide real-time updates on specific incident attributes (such as the list of emerging threat names or vulnerabilities).```*
- **Version Control**: The taxonomy has a system or a mechanism for managing and tracking changes, ensuring that every update is documented and previous versions are preserved. This criterion ensures that all modifications to the taxonomy are tracked and documented, including details such as what was changed, when it was changed, and why it was changed. Version control is critical for maintaining a clear history of updates and historical accuracy, allowing users to understand the evolution of the taxonomy and to revert to previous versions if necessary. It also ensures consistency and transparency in the updating process.<br>
  *```Example: Version numbering feature is supported and each version of the taxonomy is assigned a unique version number (e.g., "v2.0", "v2.1") to distinguish between different iterations. A change log is maintained to document the details of each update, including the date, the changes made, the rationale behind the changes, and the contributors involved. In cases where a new version introduces errors or inconsistencies, version control allows users to revert to a previous, stable version of the taxonomy until the issues are resolved.```*

### Requirement Name: Relevance and Resilience to Obsolescence
The taxonomy remains effective over time despite changes. It has a feedback mechanism for continuous evaluation and improvement, ensuring it stays relevant as new threats emerge.

- **Continuous Improvement Loops**: The taxonomy has a built-in process for ongoing evaluation, feedback, and refinement to ensure it remains relevant and effective. This criterion ensures that the taxonomy is not static but evolves continuously through feedback loops, regular assessments, stakeholder feedback, and real-world application results. Continuous improvement loops and refinement involve setting up mechanisms for gathering input from users, monitoring changes in the threat landscape, and making adjustments accordingly. This approach keeps the taxonomy aligned with current needs and ensures its effectiveness over time.<br>
  *```Example: A feedback system is implemented where cybersecurity professionals and stakeholders can submit feedback (report gaps, ambiguities, or suggested improvements) for consideration in the next update. Regular audits of the taxonomy are conducted to evaluate its performance, assess user satisfaction, and identify areas for enhancement. Performance metrics to identify strengths and weaknesses are implemented, and specific metrics, such as the time taken to classify a threat or the accuracy of threat categorization, are used to measure the taxonomy’s performance and guide iterative improvements.```*
- **Flexibility for Rapid Adaptation**: The taxonomy is designed to quickly incorporate new incident types, technologies, or changes in the cybersecurity landscape without requiring a complete overhaul. This criterion ensures that the taxonomy is adaptable and can be modified or expanded rapidly in response to emerging threats or changes in the cybersecurity environment. This flexibility minimises the risk of obsolescence and ensures that the taxonomy remains practical and valuable even as new threats or technologies emerge. The taxonomy's effectiveness is periodically evaluated to ensure flexibility to quickly adapt to shifts in the threat landscape.<br>
  *```Example: Dynamic fields or placeholders are included in the taxonomy that allow for rapid updates or additions of new categories or attributes as they become relevant. Streamlined protocols are established for rapidly updating the taxonomy. For example, an "emergency update protocol" could be triggered by a significant new threat or vulnerability, ensuring that the taxonomy is updated quickly without waiting for the regular update cycle.```*

## Requirement Group: Validation and Reliability Requirements
---
### Requirement Name: Validation Against Historical Data
The taxonomy is tested and validated using real-world data and scenarios and it undergoes testing with historical and live incident data to ensure its accuracy and effectiveness in classifying incidents.

- **Testing with Historical Data**: The taxonomy is tested against a comprehensive set of historical cyber incident data to ensure it can accurately categorise and describe past incidents. This criterion ensures that the taxonomy is evaluated by applying it to a diverse range of past incidents. By testing with historical data, organisations can identify gaps, ambiguities, or inaccuracies in the taxonomy. This helps to confirm that the taxonomy is robust and capable of handling different types of incidents, attack vectors, and incident characteristics effectively.<br>
  *```Example: The taxonomy is applied to a dataset of past cyber incidents from the last five years for retrospective analysis and verification that each incident can be accurately categorised according to the taxonomy's current structure. Incident review sessions are conducted where cybersecurity analysts use the taxonomy to classify historical incidents and to compare the results with actual classifications used when registering those incidents to identify discrepancies or areas for refinement.```*
- **Diverse Data Source Validation**: The taxonomy is validated using historical data from a variety of sources, ensuring its applicability and reliability across different contexts, scenarios, sectors, and environments. This criterion ensures that the taxonomy is versatile and effective when applied to different types of data from multiple sources. Validation with diverse data sources tests whether the taxonomy can handle variations in how incidents are described, reported, and contextualised. It helps to confirm that the taxonomy remains comprehensive and accurate regardless of the data's origin.<br>
  *```Example: The taxonomy is tested using global data sets from various geographic regions or international organisations to check whether it can handle regional differences in incident activity, terminology, and reporting. The taxonomy is applied to different data formats, such as structured reports (e.g., incident databases, logs), unstructured text (e.g., news articles, threat intelligence feeds), and qualitative descriptions (e.g., analyst notes) to confirm that it remains applicable and accurate regardless of the data's format.```*

### Requirement Name: Consistency
The taxonomy provides consistent results across different users or applications, delivers repeatable outcomes when used by different analysts or tools, and maintains uniformity in classification.

- **Minimisation of Subjective Interpretation**: The taxonomy minimises the room for subjective interpretation by different users, ensuring that the classification rules and definitions are clear and precise. This criterion ensures that users apply the taxonomy in a consistent manner, regardless of their background or experience level. To achieve this, the taxonomy should provide well-defined categories, terms, and classification guidelines, reducing ambiguity and subjective decision-making. This helps to maintain uniformity in incident categorization and analysis.<br>
  *```Example: Clear and unambiguous definitions for each category and subcategory are provided. A set of rules or decision trees that guide users in categorising incidents is developed (for example, "If an incident involves unauthorised access to sensitive data via malware, classify it under 'Data Exfiltration'."). Training materials, guidelines and examples are offered to help users to apply the taxonomy consistently. They include case studies or examples that show how to classify complex or borderline cases.```*
- **Cross-Platform and Cross-Tool Consistency**: Validation tests are conducted to confirm that the taxonomy provides consistent classification results across different platforms, tools, and environments. This criterion ensures that the taxonomy works seamlessly with various cybersecurity tools, platforms, and systems without producing inconsistent results. It requires that the taxonomy be designed and formatted in a way that is compatible with diverse software and tools, allowing organisations to use it effectively regardless of their technological stack.<br>
  *```Example: Standardised formats that are widely supported by cybersecurity tools are used to ensure consistent data exchange and classification across different platforms. Interoperability tests are conducted to confirm that the taxonomy produces the same classification results when integrated with different tools. Clear guidelines for integration and APIs are provided to ensure that the taxonomy can be embedded or linked consistently across various cybersecurity tools and environments.```*
- **Uniform Classification Results**: Validation tests are conducted to ensure that different users applying the taxonomy arrive at similar classifications for the same incidents, regardless of who uses it or how it is used. This criterion ensures that the taxonomy generates the same classification for identical or similar data sets by users every time it is applied. This uniformity is crucial for reliable data analysis, reporting, and decision-making, as it ensures that different analysts or systems produce comparable results when using the taxonomy.<br>
  *```Example: A set of standard test cases or benchmark datasets is developed that is used to verify that multiple analysts arrive at consistent results. Automated validation checks are implemented within cybersecurity tools to automatically flag any deviations or inconsistencies in classification results. Regular consensus reviews are conducted where multiple analysts independently classify the same dataset, and their results are compared to ensure alignment (any discrepancies can be analysed to refine the taxonomy further).```*

## Requirement Group: Governance and Maintenance Requirements
---
### Requirement Name: Clear Governance Model
The taxonomy has a defined governance structure to manage its development, updates, and use. Roles and responsibilities are outlined for taxonomy management, including procedures for review and approval of changes.

- **Defined Roles and Responsibilities**: The governance model clearly outlines the roles and responsibilities of everyone involved in managing and maintaining the taxonomy. This criterion ensures that there is a well-defined structure for who oversees the taxonomy's development, updates, and maintenance. It establishes clarity about who makes decisions, who reviews changes, who handles user feedback, and who is responsible for resolving issues. This clear delineation of roles helps to maintain order, accountability, and efficiency in taxonomy management.<br>
  *```Example: A governance committee is formed that is responsible for overseeing the taxonomy. Specific roles are defined and assigned (such as a "Taxonomy Manager" responsible for the overall maintenance, "Data Custodians" responsible for data integrity and validation, and "Feedback Coordinators" responsible for collecting and acting on user feedback). A RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) matrix is created that outlines who is responsible for each aspect of taxonomy governance, such as updates, training, documentation, and stakeholder communication.```*
- **Feedback and Conflict Resolution Procedures**: The governance model includes procedures for collecting feedback from users and resolving any conflicts or disputes regarding the taxonomy’s structure or content. This criterion ensures that there is a structured process for managing feedback from users and addressing disagreements that may arise regarding the taxonomy. By establishing clear feedback channels and conflict resolution mechanisms, the governance model can ensure continuous improvement of the taxonomy and maintain its relevance and accuracy.<br>
  *```Example: A feedback portal or platform (this could be an internal system within an organisation or a public-facing website where stakeholders can propose modifications or report issues) is developed for users to be able to submit feedback or suggestions for changes and have an option to flag incidents where they feel classification is unclear or overlaps multiple categories and refinements can be suggested. A set of guidelines or processes is defined for resolving conflicts that arise during taxonomy updates (for example, if there is a disagreement over how to categorise a new type of incident, a resolution procedure might involve consulting with an external panel of experts or conducting a consensus vote among the governance committee members). Quarterly meetings or workshops are scheduled to review and evaluate all submitted feedback and suggestions as well as to decide which changes should be implemented.```*
- **Stakeholder Involvement**: The governance model actively involves relevant stakeholders in the development, maintenance, and updating of the taxonomy. This criterion ensures that all relevant parties, such as cybersecurity experts, industry representatives, and end-users, are involved in the governance process. Stakeholder involvement is crucial for ensuring that the taxonomy reflects the needs of its users and remains applicable and useful across diverse contexts, goals and standards.<br>
  *```Example: Workshops or focus groups are organised with stakeholders to gather input on the taxonomy’s structure and content (for example, representatives from different sectors could provide insights on how specific threats are perceived and categorised in their industry). An advisory board is established that consists of key stakeholders, such as industry experts, government representatives, and cybersecurity professionals, who provide guidance and oversight on taxonomy updates and maintenance. Open consultation periods (a few weeks or months, depending on the scope of the changes) are announced where stakeholders are invited to provide feedback on proposed changes or updates to the taxonomy.```*
- **Structured Training Calendar**: Practitioners, contributors, and any other stakeholders who need to understand how the cyber incident taxonomy functions, how it is updated, and how to apply it effectively in cybersecurity operations, are regularly trained on its usage, updates, and best practices. This criterion helps to maintain the efficiency and accuracy of the taxonomy by ensuring that all parties are aware of how to properly utilise, maintain, and contribute to it. In such a way everyone stays up to date with the taxonomy’s structure, its use in classifying and analysing incidents, and any changes or updates that have been made. Regular training helps to prevent misinterpretation, improper usage, or errors in applying the taxonomy, which could otherwise lead to inaccurate incident classification or management. Regular training also creates a feedback loop, where users can provide suggestions or raise concerns about the taxonomy’s structure, which can be incorporated into future revisions.<br>
  *```Example: Once a year, the governing body of the taxonomy holds an annual comprehensive training session that covers all aspects of the taxonomy. This includes the current structure, new updates, practical usage scenarios, and any governance changes. A quarterly refresher webinar is conducted to inform users about small incremental changes, such as updates to incident descriptions or restructured subcategories. If the taxonomy is used across different sectors (e.g., healthcare, finance, energy), sector-specific training sessions are scheduled at regular intervals to tailor the training to the needs and use cases of each sector. For new users joining an organisation or team, there may be pre-scheduled onboarding sessions or on-demand training courses available to familiarise them with the taxonomy.```*

### Requirement Name: Regular Review Cycle
The taxonomy is reviewed and updated regularly to stay current with the evolving threat landscape. A timeline for periodic reviews (e.g., annually or semi-annually) and processes for soliciting feedback from users and stakeholders are established.

- **Scheduled Review Timelines**: The taxonomy follows a set schedule for reviews and updates to ensure it stays up-to-date with the latest cyber incidents and industry standards. This criterion ensures that the taxonomy is not left stagnant and that reviews happen at regular intervals (e.g., annually, biannually, or quarterly). The scheduled reviews help to identify outdated classifications, new emerging threats, or areas where the taxonomy might need improvement. Having a fixed timeline for reviews guarantees that the taxonomy remains current and reflective of the rapidly changing cyber incident landscape.<br>
  *```Example: An annual review process is established where the governance committee examines the taxonomy to ensure it includes all relevant categories and addresses emerging incident types. Also smaller, focused mini-reviews are conducted on specific sections of the taxonomy (e.g., reviewing cloud security incidents every quarter) to ensure that rapidly evolving areas are addressed in a timely manner. A clear timetable is developed outlining when reviews should happen, who is responsible for them, and what aspects of the taxonomy should be reviewed during each cycle.```*
- **Expert Participation**: A diverse range of experts and stakeholders from various domains are involved in the review process to ensure that updates are informed by the latest expertise. This criterion ensures that the review process includes participation from domain experts who can bring valuable insights, assess the taxonomy’s structure, suggest improvements, and ensure that it remains comprehensive and accurate. Expert participation adds credibility to the review process and helps to address complex or nuanced cyber incidents.<br>
  *```Example: A panel of cybersecurity experts (professionals from different fields like network security, cloud security, and threat intelligence to provide specialised insights on specific incident categories) who contribute their knowledge during each review cycle is created. Experts from external organisations are invited, such as government cybersecurity agencies or academic institutions, to participate in the review process to ensure that the taxonomy aligns with both industry best practices and evolving cyber incident trends. In cases where new threat categories are emerging (e.g., quantum computing risks), guest experts with specialised knowledge are involved to provide relevant updates or propose new classifications.```*
- **Practitioner Feedback Monitoring and Processing**: The review process incorporates feedback mechanisms from the practitioners who use the taxonomy regularly, ensuring that practical, real-world insights guide its evolution. This criterion ensures that feedback from cybersecurity practitioners — those on the front lines of incident detection and response — is actively collected, monitored, and considered during the review cycle. Practitioners can provide crucial insights about the taxonomy’s usability, clarity, and coverage, ensuring that it is not just theoretically sound but also practical and functional. Processing their feedback enables the taxonomy to remain relevant to everyday cybersecurity challenges.<br>
  *```Example: A feedback submission system is created where practitioners can submit feedback on the taxonomy throughout the year, highlighting any categories that are confusing, outdated, or incomplete. Regular surveys or interviews with practitioners are conducted to gather insights on the taxonomy's effectiveness. A formal process for evaluating and integrating practitioner feedback during the review cycle is developed. This could involve categorising feedback based on its urgency and relevance, then discussing it during review meetings to prioritise necessary updates.```*
